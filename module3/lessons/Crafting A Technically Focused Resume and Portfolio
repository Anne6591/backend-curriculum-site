Slides

## Learning Goals
* Understand how to tell your professional story through your resume
* Learn how to tailor your resume to the Tech Industry
* Build a working draft of your resume that is both technically focused and ATS-Friendly
* Learn how a portfolio can showcase your skills, projects, and personal brand to potential employers. Set up your Turing portfolio

## Important Sections in a Technical Resume
### Header

Name
* If you go by multiple names, include both: William “Matthew” Millar
* Email 
* Phone number
* City & State (optional - helpful if you’re targeting a specific area) 
* TITLE - THIS IS IMPORTANT 
* Software Developer; Front-End Software Developer, etc. 
* Hyperlinks to your LinkedIn and Github

Summary Statement
* Optional, but helpful to “connect the dots” as a career changer 
* Might not use it due to space
* If used: should be short statements (not full sentences) that connect your transferable skills and past experiences with your career aspirations 

Skills & Keywords
* Skills are absolutely essential in the tech industry, so this section is vital 
* This section helps get your resume through an ATS - e.g., if the ATS is set to look for resumes with CSS listed, you definitely need to have CSS on your resume! 
* Good rule of thumb: Include skills you’re comfortable talking about in an interview 
* Aim for 9-12 keywords and skills 

Technical Projects
ESSENTIAL - arguably the most important part! 
* These will change as you go through Turing; the ones you have now will be placeholders 
* Make sure to include both the repo and deployed link
* Specify solo, paired, or group project
* How to describe the projects 
* Help the reader understand what the project was, what problem it solved or what it was built for, and the technologies that were used 
* HOWEVER, it’s extra important to show what YOU contributed to the project - not just a description of what the project was
* Think about answering the questions: What was your role in the project? What specific metrics or goals did you meet? What was the result/impact of your project/work? 

Work Experience
* Shorter than projects section - select the most relevant experiences and bullets
* Can use Turing as Experience IF you don’t have ANY previous work experience
* WHY - any previous experience, even if it isn’t corporate, still matters - we’ll talk more about this!
* Use strong action verbs to start
* Show accomplishments, not duties - don’t just regurgitate the job description 

Education & Training
* Include other degrees, licenses, and certifications as relevant to your job search 
* List in reverse chronological order - most recent to least recent (starting with Turing!)

Writing Effective Bullets
* Employers don’t just want to know the job description of your previous roles - they want to know how or why you did something, what you accomplished, and what the result was
* Avoid using personal pronouns (I, we, my) to make it more focused on the action
* When you are writing a bullet, ask yourself: What skill do I want to focus on showcasing here? 
* When you read a bullet, ask yourself: What skill am I highlighting here? What story am I telling? 
* When writing bullets, a great formula to follow is: Action Verb + Task or Project + Metric or Result

What’s an ATS-Friendly Resume?
* First - What is an Applicant Tracking System, or ATS? 
* It’s not just a job search buzzword! 
* It’s a human resource software that helps automate the hiring process and speed it up for recruitment teams 
* An ATS can: 
* Store candidate information easily 
* Track candidates through the hiring pipeline 
* Weed out unqualified candidates based on the parameters set by HR 
* Automate tasks like screening applicants, reading resumes, sending status updates, etc. 

ATS has very specific ways of reading resumes!
So, there are certain things that are very important to consider when creating a technically-focused resume. The first is that an ATS parses your resume for specific keywords and qualifications set by HR pertaining to the job description. This impacts you in two ways: 
* Resume Format
* Relevant Sections and Keywords

ATS Resume Formatting
Some things to know about how an ATS reads a resume: 
* Your resume should likely be only one page
* Unlike humans, an ATS reads top to bottom and left to right 
* As a result, you should not use columns, tables, or graphics on your resume! 

Relevant Sections & Keywords
* ATS also look for sections & keywords specific to the job description. So, it’s important to:
* Tailor your resume to the job you’re applying for rather than submitting the same resume everywhere 
* Make sure your sections have standard titles so as not to confuse an ATS. For example: 
* “Skills” instead of “What I Can Do” 
* “Work Experience” instead of “Where I’ve Been”
