Okay, so Figaro no longer works on Ruby 3.2+ and though there is a fix sitting in a PR, I donâ€™t think that we can expect this to go away.

So this is a great opportunity to start using Rails Encrypted Credentials. 

First, with VS Code, you have to be able to launch it from the command line, instructions on how to do so available here:

[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#:~:text=Keep in Dock.-,Launching from the command line,code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#:~:text=Keep%20in%20Dock.-,Launching%20from%20the%20command%20line,code)'%20command%20in%20PATH%20command.

Rails will encrypt our credentials for us. It encrypts with a master key that is generated. This key allows us to check the encrypted credentials we may be using to a VCS such as GitHub without the fear of having them compromised. Without the key, it is useless. 

The first step is to generate our master key. We can do this by adding credentials we want encrypted.

```bash
$ EDITOR="code --wait" rails credentials:edit
```

When we run this command, a new key is created in `config/master.key` and it creates a credentials temp file thats opened in your browser.

We need to do the wait to make sure that the encryption happens after the edits have been saved and the editor closed. 

This just a YAML file like we have used with Figaro.

Lets replace the scaffold with our key like so:

```yaml
propublica:
  key: asdsa3498serghjirteg978ertertwhter

# Used as the base secret for all MessageVerifiers in Rails, including the one protecting cookies.
secret_key_base: ugsdfeadsfg98a7sd987asjkas98asd87asdkdwfdg876fgd
```

Generally good idea to nest things to keep ourselves organized.

And now we save and close the yaml file.

When you do this you should see in your terminal that your file was encrypted and saved. 

Now we need to change our controller to use the key. 

Previously you had something like this:

```ruby
class SearchController < ApplicationController
  def index
    state = params[:state]

    conn = Faraday.new(url: "https://api.propublica.org") do |faraday|
      faraday.headers["X-API-Key"] = ENV["PROPUBLICA_API_KEY"]
    end

    response = conn.get("/congress/v1/members/house/#{state}/current.json")

    json = JSON.parse(response.body, symbolize_names: true)
    @members = json[:results]
  end
end
```

And now if we follow the format above:

```ruby
class SearchController < ApplicationController
  def index
    state = params[:state]

    conn = Faraday.new(url: "https://api.propublica.org") do |faraday|
      faraday.headers["X-API-Key"] = Rails.application.credentials.propublica[:key]
    end

    response = conn.get("/congress/v1/members/house/#{state}/current.json")

    json = JSON.parse(response.body, symbolize_names: true)
    @members = json[:results]
  end
end
```

Now to work with this with a team - its the contents of the `config/master.key` file you need to share with your teammates securely, and they need to go and create this file with that key as the contents.
