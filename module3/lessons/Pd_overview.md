During Mod 3, students will develop employer-ready application materials and interview skills based on networking conversations, guided reflections, and feedback from earlier modules. Using portfolios, resumes, cover letters, and behavioral interview lessons, students will learn how to effectively communicate accomplishments, transferrable skills, and technical expertise. 

By the end of Mod 3, students will have developed the following:
* Crafted a technical-focused and ATS-friendly resume: Students will learn how to create a resume that highlights their technical skills and is optimized for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) used by companies during the hiring process.

* Developed a working cover letter: Students will be able to write a cover letter that effectively communicates their unique value, genuine interest in the company, and alignment with the specific roles they are applying for.

* Started building their Terminal Portfolio: Students will begin creating a portfolio that showcases their achievements, skills, and projects to prospective employers. This portfolio will serve as a visual representation of their capabilities and experiences.

* Learned effective interview techniques: Students will learn how to navigate interviews and confidently answer common interview questions. They will develop strategies for showcasing their skills and experiences in a compelling and concise manner.

* Refined their career goals: Throughout Mod 3, students will continue to develop a blueprint for their job search. They will focus on identifying what they want out of their new career, building on their professional story. They will leverage their professional experiences to shape their narrative and evaluate how their unique strengths align with finding a rewarding and fulfilling career trajectory.

Students will demonstrate professional readiness to move to Mod 4 with the submission of  an ATS-friendly resume, terminal portfolio bio,  a master cover letter draft  that meets expectations, and thoughtful reflections on their job search blueprint during their Final Portfolio Review.
